**Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK in Python**

Welcome to the NLP with NLTK GitHub repository! In this project, we will dive into various NLP concepts and techniques using the NLTK library in Python. This README.md file serves as your guide through the objectives and topics we'll cover.

## Tokenization
- Learn the concept of tokenization, breaking down text into tokens.
- Apply tokenization techniques for word and sentence segmentation.
- Python Implementation: `nltk.tokenize`
- Practice: Tokenization exercises and hands-on examples in [Tokenization.ipynb](Tokenization.ipynb).

## Stopword Removal
- Understand stopwords and their impact on NLP tasks.
- Identify common stopwords and their role in text analysis.
- Implement techniques to remove stopwords from text data.
- Python Implementation: `nltk.corpus.stopwords`, text preprocessing.
- Practice: Stopword removal exercises in [Stopword_Removal.ipynb](Stopword_Removal.ipynb).

## Parts of Speech Tagging
- Learn about parts of speech (POS) and their grammatical roles.
- Explore POS categories: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.
- Apply POS tagging techniques to label words in sentences.
- Python Implementation: `nltk.pos_tag`
- Practice: Parts of speech tagging exercises in [Parts_of_Speech_Tagging.ipynb](Parts_of_Speech_Tagging.ipynb).

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Understand named entities' significance in NLP.
- Identify named entity types: persons, locations, organizations, dates.
- Implement NER techniques to extract entities from text.
- Python Implementation: `nltk.ne_chunk`
- Practice: Named Entity Recognition exercises in [Named_Entity_Recognition.ipynb](Named_Entity_Recognition.ipynb).

## Sentiment Analysis using VADER
- Introduction to sentiment analysis and its importance.
- Introduce VADER for sentiment analysis, a pre-trained model.
- Apply VADER to analyze sentiment in text and interpret results.
- Python Implementation: `nltk.sentiment.vader`
- Practice: Sentiment Analysis using VADER in [Sentiment_Analysis_using_VADER.ipynb](Sentiment_Analysis_using_VADER.ipynb).
