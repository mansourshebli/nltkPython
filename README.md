# **NLP with NLTK in Python** üöÄ

Welcome to my NLTK NLP project on GitHub! üìö This repository is a documentation of my hands-on exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques using the NLTK library in Python. Below, I'll walk you through the exciting topics I've delved into.

## **Tokenization** üìù
In this phase, I explored the fascinating world of tokenization, where text is sliced into meaningful units called tokens. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Learned the Concept:** Grasped the essence of tokenization and its importance.
- **Applied Techniques:** Utilized NLTK's `nltk.tokenize` module to segment text into words and sentences.
- **Practical Implementation:** Delved into Python code to practice tokenization.
- **Exercises and Examples:** Worked on hands-on exercises and examples showcased in [Tokenization.ipynb](Tokenization.ipynb).

## **Stopword Removal** üõë
This phase helped me understand the significance of stopwords and how they impact NLP tasks. My achievements include:

- **Identifying Stopwords:** Recognized commonly used stopwords and their role in text analysis.
- **Removal Techniques:** Explored effective strategies to eliminate irrelevant words from text data.
- **Python Implementation:** Applied NLTK's `nltk.corpus.stopwords` and text preprocessing techniques.
- **Practical Application:** Engaged with exercises showcased in [Stopword_Removal.ipynb](Stopword_Removal.ipynb) to practice stopword removal.

## **Parts of Speech Tagging** üìä
Diving into grammatical analysis, I focused on understanding parts of speech and their roles. Here's what I achieved:

- **Understanding POS:** Explored the concept of parts of speech and their grammatical categories.
- **POS Tagging:** Leveraged NLTK's `nltk.pos_tag` to assign appropriate tags to words.
- **Real-world Application:** Implemented parts of speech tagging through practical exercises and examples in [Parts_of_Speech_Tagging.ipynb](Parts_of_Speech_Tagging.ipynb).

## **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** üèôÔ∏è
Named entities gained my attention as I delved into identifying and extracting various types. Here's a summary of my achievements:

- **Significance of NER:** Understood the importance of named entities in NLP.
- **Types of Entities:** Identified different categories like persons, locations, organizations, and dates.
- **NER Techniques:** Applied NLTK's `nltk.ne_chunk` to extract named entities from text.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Engaged in interactive activities and exercises in [Named_Entity_Recognition.ipynb](Named_Entity_Recognition.ipynb) to reinforce NER skills.

## **Sentiment Analysis using VADER** üòÉüòî
Emotions in text fascinated me as I ventured into sentiment analysis using the VADER tool. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Understanding Sentiment Analysis:** Grasped the role of sentiment analysis in determining emotional polarity.
- **Introduction to VADER:** Explored the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner as a pre-trained model.
- **Analyzing Sentiment:** Applied VADER to analyze text sentiment and interpreted results.
- **Practical Exercises:** Engaged in hands-on activities in [Sentiment_Analysis_using_VADER.ipynb](Sentiment_Analysis_using_VADER.ipynb) to perform sentiment analysis using VADER.

Feel free to join me on this enriching journey, explore the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks, and practice the exercises to enhance your NLP skills. Enjoy the process of learning and discovery! üåüüêç
