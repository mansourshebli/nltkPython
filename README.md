# **NLP with NLTK in Python** üöÄ

Welcome to my NLTK NLP project on GitHub! üìö This repository is a documentation of my hands-on exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques using the NLTK library in Python. Below, I'll walk you through some very very very simple examples I did with the following:
> üí° **Note:** It took me a while to put together this documentation. I hope you find it helpful! üëÄ

## **Tokenization** üìù
In this phase, I explored the fascinating world of tokenization, where text is sliced into meaningful units called tokens. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Learned the Concept:** Understood the essence of tokenization and its importance.
- **Applied Techniques:** Utilized NLTK's `nltk.tokenize` module to segment text into words and sentences.
- **Practical Implementation:** Delved into Python code to practice tokenization.
- **Exercises and Examples:** Worked on hands-on exercise and example with matplotlib library showcased in [Tokenization.py](Tokenization.py).

## **Stopword Removal** üõë
This phase helped me understand the significance of stopwords and how they impact NLP tasks. My achievements include:

- **Identifying Stopwords:** Recognized commonly used stopwords and their role in text analysis.
- **Removal Techniques:** Explored effective strategies to eliminate irrelevant words from text data.
- **Python Implementation:** Applied NLTK's `nltk.corpus.stopwords` and text preprocessing techniques.
- **Practical Application:** Engaged with exercise showcased in [Stopword_Removal.py](Stopword_Removal.py) to practice stopword removal.

## **Parts of Speech Tagging** üìä
Diving into grammatical analysis, I focused on understanding parts of speech and their roles. Here's what I achieved:

- **Understanding POS:** Explored the concept of parts of speech and their grammatical categories.
- **POS Tagging:** Leveraged NLTK's `nltk.pos_tag` to assign appropriate tags to words.
- **Real-world Application:** Implemented parts of speech tagging through practical exercise and example in [Parts_of_Speech_Tagging.py](Parts_of_Speech_Tagging.py).

## **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** üèôÔ∏è
Named entities gained my attention as I delved into identifying and extracting various types. Here's a summary of my achievements:

- **Significance of NER:** Understood the importance of named entities in NLP.
- **Types of Entities:** Identified different categories like persons, locations, organizations, and dates.
- **NER Techniques:** Applied NLTK's `nltk.ne_chunk` to extract named entities from text.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Engaged in interactive activities and exercises in [Named_Entity_Recognition.py](Named_Entity_Recognition.py) to reinforce NER skills.

## **Sentiment Analysis using VADER** üòÉüòî
Emotions in text fascinated me as I ventured into sentiment analysis using the VADER tool. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Understanding Sentiment Analysis:** Grasped the role of sentiment analysis in determining emotional polarity ( it was cooool :) 
- **Introduction to VADER:** Explored the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner as a pre-trained model.
- **Analyzing Sentiment:** Applied VADER to analyze text sentiment and interpreted results.
- **Practical Exercises:** Engaged in hands-on activities in [Sentiment_Analysis_using_VADER.py](Sentiment_Analysis_using_VADER.py) to perform sentiment analysis using VADER.

And most importantly Enjoy the process of learning and discovery! üåüüêç
